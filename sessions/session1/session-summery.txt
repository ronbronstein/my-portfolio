- Configured project with Tailwind CSS and ESLint
- Set up source directory structure
- Configured custom import alias (@/*)

## Core Theme Implementation
1. Matrix Theme Configuration (theme.ts)
   - Defined core color palette (Matrix green: #00ff00)
   - Set up animation timing constants
   - Created text effect variants for Framer Motion
   - Implemented Matrix character set for animations

2. Background Animation (MatrixRain.tsx)
   - Created canvas-based Matrix rain effect
   - Implemented performance optimizations
   - Added responsive canvas sizing
   - Set up character dropping animation
   - Configured opacity and fade effects

3. Interactive Node System
   - Base Node Component (BaseNode.tsx):
     * Implemented motion animations
     * Created locked/unlocked states
     * Added hover effects
     * Set up active state styling

   - Node System (NodeSystem.tsx):
     * Created node connection visualization
     * Implemented node dependency system
     * Set up node unlocking mechanics
     * Added canvas-based connection lines
     * Configured node positioning

4. Content Display System
   - Matrix Modal (MatrixModal.tsx):
     * Created animated modal component
     * Implemented backdrop effects
     * Added keyboard controls (Escape to close)
     * Set up content transitions

   - Content Management (nodeContent.ts):
     * Structured content for each node
     * Created content categories
     * Set up initial content

5. Layout and Integration
   - Updated root layout with Matrix theme
   - Integrated MatrixRain background
   - Set up responsive container structure
   - Configured z-index layering

## Current Features
1. Visual Elements:
   - Animated Matrix rain background
   - Interactive circular nodes
   - Glowing connection lines
   - Matrix-themed modals
   - Smooth animations and transitions

2. Interaction System:
   - Progressive node unlocking
   - Click-to-reveal content
   - Hover effects on nodes
   - Modal-based content display

3. Content Structure:
   - Introduction node
   - Work portfolio section
   - Music collection
   - Sticker gallery
   - Essays/writing section

## Technical Implementation Details
- Framer Motion for animations
- Canvas API for Matrix rain
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Next.js App Router structure

## Files Created
1. src/lib/theme.ts - Theme configuration and constants
2. src/lib/nodeContent.ts - Content management system
3. src/components/matrix/MatrixRain.tsx - Background animation
4. src/components/nodes/BaseNode.tsx - Core node component
5. src/components/nodes/NodeSystem.tsx - Node management system
6. src/components/shared/MatrixModal.tsx - Content display system
7. src/app/layout.tsx (modified) - Root layout integration
8. src/app/page.tsx (modified) - Homepage implementation

## Next Steps
1. Add more visual effects and animations
2. Create detailed content for each section
3. Implement additional node types
4. Add more Matrix-themed interactions
5. Optimize performance for mobile devices
