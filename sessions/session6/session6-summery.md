Session 6 Summary - Hydration Fixes and Matrix Rain Debugging
Project Status Overview
Fixed critical hydration errors and resolved issues with the Matrix rain background animation, ensuring proper server-side rendering (SSR) compatibility across the application.
Core Implementation

Hydration Error Resolution

Fixed TypeScript errors related to null canvas/context references
Implemented proper client-side rendering detection
Added robust null checking throughout the codebase
Resolved "Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client" error


Matrix Rain Animation Fixes

Created debugging canvas visualization to confirm rendering capability
Fixed timing and state management for animations
Ensured canvas resizing works properly
Added explicit z-index management
Implemented proper cleanup for animations to prevent memory leaks


Node System Enhancements

Improved canvas connection line drawing
Added additional safety checks for all client-side operations
Fixed rendering conditions to prevent SSR/CSR mismatches
Enhanced node state management to be SSR-safe



Technical Implementation Details
Key Issues Fixed

'ctx' is possibly 'null' errors - Added proper null checks before using canvas context
'canvas' is possibly 'null' errors - Added safety checks for canvas references
Hydration mismatch errors - Ensured server and client rendering match initially
Invisible Matrix rain - Fixed component mounting and z-index issues

Important Code Changes

Client-Side Safety Pattern
typescriptCopyconst [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true);
}, []);

// Don't render during SSR
if (!isClient) {
  return null; // or a simple placeholder
}

Proper Canvas Context Handling
typescriptCopyfunction drawConnections() {
  if (!canvas || !ctx) return; // Safety check
  
  // Canvas operations here
}

Robust Cleanup
typescriptCopyuseEffect(() => {
  // Setup code
  
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    if (animationId) {
      cancelAnimationFrame(animationId);
    }
  };
}, [dependencies]);

State-Based Dimensions
typescriptCopyconst [dimensions, setDimensions] = useState({ width: 0, height: 0 });

useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return;
  
  const updateDimensions = () => {
    setDimensions({
      width: window.innerWidth,
      height: window.innerHeight
    });
  };
  
  updateDimensions();
  window.addEventListener('resize', updateDimensions);
  
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', updateDimensions);
}, []);
